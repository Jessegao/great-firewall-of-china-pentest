Describe (in 2-3 paragraphs) your evasion strategy:

First we set up a tcp connection with the target server. The handshake process itself tries to reconnect 50 times if the connection doesn't go through, either due to packet loss or flaky internet. After performing the handshake, we take the "forbidden" message to be sent and fragment it into single character payloads. This is to prevent the server from easily scanning our message for string matches.

The next part involves sending the fragments in an order that fools the wall. Essentially we used the traceroute to find the minimum ttl needed for a packet to reach the firewall, and then create a garbage packet with that ttl to be sent alongside the proper fragment with the same sequence number. The garbage packet is sent first, so it will hopefully reach the firewall first and will expire before it reaches the target server. Afterwards, we would most likely get a response from the server, which we will concantenate and return.
