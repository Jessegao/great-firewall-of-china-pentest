# Bypassing the "Great Firewall"

#### Jesse Gao

This was a class project where our goal was to get a message containing censored words to a server in China without encrypting it. There were a number of methods but my implementation uses a combination of garbage packets and timing described below.
1. The message was split up into packets containing a single character of the message
2. A garbage packet is generated with the same offset as a corresponding packet of the original message
3. The garbage packet is sent before the corresponding legit packet but the garbage packet has a way shorter time to live
4. The garbage packet's ttl is adjusted so that it reaches the "firewall" DNS server but gets dropped on the way to the target server
5. The target server reassembles the message and does its thing

Overall it was a very fun project and I pretty much had free reign over the methods of transmission, as the teacher gave a very minimal skeleton.
